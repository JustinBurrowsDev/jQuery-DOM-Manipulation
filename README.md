# jQuery DOM Manipulation

## Challenges I Faced? 

Just from looking at the mockup I had difficulty trying to ascertain just exactly how the logic of the accordion form would work using JavaScript and the jQuery library.

## How Did I Over Come Those Challenges? 

Before I started coding anything I drew out exactly what it was I was trying to do on a whiteboard and how the logic would work step-by-step in common English. After I did that I received a clear understanding of what needed to be researched. By leveraging platforms like Google, YouTube, MDN docs, Stackoverflow, GitHub, online courses, and reference guides I was able to find the proper JavaScript methods and functions needed to complete the task and I programmed the form accordingly.
